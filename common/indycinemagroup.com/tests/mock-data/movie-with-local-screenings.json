    "synopsis": "Nicole Kidman shines as a high-powered executive who puts her life's work and her marriage on the line when she begins a torrid, sado-masochistic affair with much younger employee in this bold, darkly funny and erotic thriller from writer-director Halina Reijn.\n\nWhen Romy meets Samuel, an impertinent intern at her company, who can intuit more about her than she intends to share — and who’s happy to take control — it’s only a matter of time before a roller-coaster of frenzied desire and psychological manipulation is triggered…\n\nNicole Kidman’s fearless performance won her the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and there is sterling support from Antonio Banderas as her husband and Harris Dickinson as her lover. And although centred on one woman's sexual desire, BABYGIRL also explores the complexities of power relationships – and takes a few unexpected turns along the way.",

And although centred on one woman's sexual desire, BABYGIRL also explores the complexities of power relationships – and takes a few unexpected turns along the way.",

One morning, Orlando is shocked to wake up as a woman and returns home, struggling as a female to retain her status and property as the centuries roll by.\n\n\"Potter began making films in the 1980s as part of a radical artistic scene working in response to the neoconservatism of Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Section 28, which prohibited the \"promotion of homosexuality\" by local authorities, was introduced in 1988, against the backdrop of the escalating Aids crisis. Filmmakers such as Derek Jarman reacted to this heightened homophobia by making outspoken work centring queer politics, boundary-pushing films that found a home on television on the newly launched Channel 4.\nAlthough it does not offer explicit political critique, Orlando radically centres queer culture, and is full of references that speak to LGBTQI+ viewers across the generations. By casting an 83-year-old Quentin Crisp as Queen Elizabeth I, Potter pays tribute to a gay icon while adding another layer to the film's discussion of identity. Described by Potter as \"the Queen of Queens,\" Crisp would go on to identify as transgender and use she/her pronouns in the final years of her life. Rewatching the film with this knowledge adds a dimension to the film's reflections on the mutability of gender.\" BBC\n\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!",

Benjamin Wigley, UK 2024, 30mins\n\nThe esoteric and extraordinary begin to leak into the domestic sphere in this selection of three haunting shorts. Join us on a ritualistic journey from the desolate moors of 1970s Northumberland to a derelict house in post-Industrial Chicago, and onwards to the myths and masks contained within the Carboniferous fossil collection at Birmingham's Lapworth Museum of Geology.\n\nArtist-filmmaker Susanne Deekin deconstructs an abandoned house, which serves as a canvas for a phantasmagorical stop-motion painting over the walls, floors, ceilings, furniture and stairs. Belgian artists Chloë Delanghe and Mattijs Driesen document a series of paranormal events that took place in Hexham, Northumberland in the early '70s upon the unearthing of two mysterious stone heads. Filmmaker Benjamin Wigley delves into the museum’s collections to create hand-crafted photographic prints, etchings, drawings, sculptures and costumes that feed into a single channel, hand-processed 16mm film, a further material layer that infuses myth, mask, and folkloric traditions.\n\nThe filmmakers will be in conversation after the screening.",

Stereotypically, action has been associated with one type of voice or violence. Here, new characters are brought center stage to reveal stunning swordsmanship in FKA Twigs' Sad Day, consider East Asian paying customs in Split, the impact of periods in Overdrive, the protection of our elders in Don’t F*ck with, Ba and the iniquity of boarding schools in Nida Manzoor’s early short, 7.2. \n\nJoin us for a Q&A after with some of the shorts directors and Ayesha Hussain (Deadpool & Wolverine, Gladiator II). \n\nSad Day, dir.

    "synopsis": "Pink Palace present BUDDIES.\n\nOriginally released in cinemas in 1985, the film is a deeply moving portrayal of the start of the AIDS crisis and how the lesbian and gay communities organised themselves to fight it, in the face of government inaction and hostile media.\n\nThe very first full length drama about AIDS, BUDDIES focuses on 25 year - old gay yuppie David (David Schachter) who volunteers to be a “buddy” to an AIDS patient. The gay community centre assigns him to Robert (Geoff Edholm), a 32 year - old politically impassioned California gardener abandoned by his friends and lovers. Revolving around the confines of Robert’s Manhattan hospital room, Bressan skillfully unfolds this two - hander with devastating effect. Tragically both Arthur J. Bressan and Geoff Edholm went on to die from complications of AIDS.\n\n\"Bressan Jr’s film is full of fury, both explicit and subtle. It takes aim at the Reagan administration’s failure to act on the Aids crisis, and hits its target again and again. Compare this with the glossy Oscar-winning theatrics of Tom Hanks’s opera scene in Philadelphia (1993) and the pugnacious spirit of Buddies seems even more potent. Yes, it’s appalling that young men are dying, but the tragedy must be coupled with a fierce resolve to fight back – a battle cry ignored by so many Aids dramas of the era, which got lost in the excitement of A-list straight actors playing tragic gay victims.\n\nEdholm, who also died from Aids-related illness in 1989, has an arresting scene where he chokes with anger when he reads a homophobic article stating that Aids is God’s punishment on gay men. Yet the most powerful sequence pulsates with an understated rage; a final overhead shot of the White House cuts to a printer churning out an endless list of those who have died from Aids-related illness.\n\nBuddies’ authenticity is its greatest strength. This is a rare film from the era, made by and about gay men, and it movingly evokes the loneliness and isolation of so many with Aids. Robert never leaves his hospital room, where he lies alone, surrounded by messages warning medics to exert caution around Aids patients.\" BFI\n\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!",

    "synopsis": "Pink Palace presents John Schlesinger's pioneering drama that shocked the middle classes in the early 70's with its frank and explicit portrayal of a bisexual love triangle.\n\n\"With a screenplay by novelist and film critic Penelope Gilliatt, John Schlesinger’s Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) was a pivotal moment in British cinema. After the Oscar-winning sensation of his New York street-hustler saga Midnight Cowboy (1969), Schlesinger returned to the UK for another groundbreaking portrayal of sexuality. His new film would prove radical by staying unusually true to everyday London life.\nPeter Finch and Glenda Jackson star in John Schlesinger’s piercing and brilliantly observed suburban drama.\nA recent divorcée (Jackson) and middle-aged Jewish doctor (Finch) find themselves embroiled in a progressive love triangle with a bisexual artist (Murray Head). Both discover a new freedom with their young lover, as they confront the conventions and obstacles that have defined their lives.\nAn exploration of middle-class life and permissiveness in 1970s London, its depiction of bisexuality changed the landscape of LGBTQ+ representation on screen. Featuring outstanding, BAFTA-winning performances by Finch and Jackson, Sunday Bloody Sunday is a tender and complex view on the politics of love, lust and longing.\" BFI\n\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\n\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!",

We discover the transgender trans - Hijra  community of Delhi as they set about creating India’s first ever trans modelling agency and an extravagant, paradigm-shifting, catwalk event.\n\nFar from a bleak story of suffering and discrimination, this film explores the world of India’s ‘third gender’ (Hijra) in a positive way, full of laughter, drama, excitement, and pathos. We discover a complex world where traditional Hindu values clash with modern human rights. We immerse ourselves in unfamiliar places but find identifiable stories of love and loss, hope and poverty, beauty, glamour, and catwalk glory.\n\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\n\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!",

This unique archival assemblage celebrates the fans and their cameras, as much as the band itself - a collision/collusion of the ephemeral moment on stage, and the moments captured on camera.\n\nFollowed by a Q&A with directors Joe Gross, Joseph Pattisall and Jeff Krulik, Live via Zoom.",

But the relationship falls apart when his partner wants the freedom to explore other bodies and experiences without the encumbrance of a live-in lover. So begins an odyssey of new relationships in a city full of possibilities. His circle of arty friends are energetic consumers of everything the city has to offer – drugs, sex, clubs and each other. \nAlthough broken-hearted, Moritz goes with the flow of the city, discovering the joys of sexual abandon. With each new encounter – straight, gay and a flirtation with S&M – he understands more of himself and how to fulfil people’s desires. A coming-of-age story with a difference, \nDrifter is a revelatory portrait of an individual becoming sexually and emotionally confident, learning about friendship, sex and the thrill of living in the moment. Hannes Hirsch’s hugely impressive feature debut is a refreshing and authentic look at queer lives, imbued with the excitement of this generation’s ways of being.\" BFI\n\nPlease note there are NO ads or trailers, we start on time!\n\nPink Palace is a super low fi highly relaxed event that takes place in the basement bar, its a safe queer space so come along and catch some queer film and pop culture history, each week the film is introduced by curator Andrew Woodyatt, and feel free to stay and chat afterwards, participation is encouraged!",

In Malick’s version of events, Holly (Sissy Spacek), a baton-twirling girl-next-door, meets Kit (Martin Sheen), a James Dean type from the wrong side of the tracks, while he’s working as a garbage collector outside her home in smalltown South Dakota. They quickly fall in love and not before long find themselves making tracks for the titular ‘badlands’ of Montana, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Despite being punctuated by violence, Badlands is at its heart a hopelessly romantic, deeply tender film, with Sheen and Spacek setting the template for on-screen errant young couples for years to come.\n\n<b><u>Moonrise Kingdom (2012)</b></u>\nMoonrise Kingdom follows in the tradition of the great American adventure story, concerning a couple of star-crossed kids who find comfort in each other’s idiosyncrasies and decide to run away together: it could have been called The Ballad of Sam and Suzy. Of course, this being a Wes Anderson film, our preteen protagonists (played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) quite often appear more grown up than the adults who conspire to thwart their union. Set in 1960s New England on the fictional island of New Penzance, Moonrise Kingdom contains narrative and visual allusions to everyone from Agnès Varda and Arthur C. Clarke, to Norman Rockwell and Satyajit Ray. But its most significant spiritual connection is with Badlands, Terrence Malick’s lilting tale of young lovers on the lam.\n\n<b><u>Adam Woodward bio</b></u>\nAdam Woodward is Editor-At-Large at Little White Lies magazine, where he has been writing about film since 2009.

She began as an Academy Award-nominated lyricist for Hollywood musicals with songs for Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Dionne Warwick, before a tabloid scandal and public breakdown led to her re-emergence as a cult artist in the Laurel Canyon scene. \n\nThe film draws on archives for its compelling story as J. Smith-Cameron (Succession) reads the voices in Dory’s head. Previn’s eloquent articulation of her relationship with her voices anticipates the burgeoning Hearing Voices and Mad Pride movements that are revolutionising how we now understand mental health.",

The adrenaline-filled live shows, controversial lyrics and provocative looks associated with the genre often shocked the music press and fuelled the audience's imagination, leaving a burning mark on the hearts and minds of the genre’s fans.\n\nNow, four decades later, EBM still has a big impact on techno and modern clubbing music. A wide and devoted fan community from all around the globe keeps its cult alive, organising regular festivals and events. The documentary offers a unique journey into EBM’s iconic sound, showcasing rare archive videos, unreleased live footage and exclusive interviews with the genre’s trailblazers, including DAF, Front 242, and Liaisons Dangereuses.",

With its vivid portrayals of torture, occult rituals, and the Inquisition, the film was highly controversial, facing censorship and bans in various countries. Despite this, Häxan is now recognised as a groundbreaking work that paved the way for modern documentary and horror cinema.​\n\n“AUTOHAUs make fractal music; layering fuzzed-out noise and electronic drones, motorik percussion and hypnotic bass lines… a must for fans of Spacemen3, The Cosmic Dead, Ash Ra Tempel and Neu!”",
